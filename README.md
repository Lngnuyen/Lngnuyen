Welcome, this is a work in progress. It'll get better as I figure out Github more. 

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lngnuyen
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics, 3d printing, and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about general robotics and reobotics control systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything robotics related. I have literally no experience, but I'll looking to learn through trial and error.
- 📫 You can reach me at contact@lngnuyen.com
